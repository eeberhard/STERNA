# STERNA

This repository contains some C++ code examples from 
my Master's project, which was a solar-powered
autonomous sailboat called STERNA.

The code examples include a GPS utility class that
converts between latitude-longitude representation
to local cartesian grid representations, and can
return distance and angle estimates.

It also includes a Pose Estimator for the sailboat,
using a Monte Carlo particle filter and a state model
of the boat dynamics to increase the 
robustness and precision of GPS navigation.
